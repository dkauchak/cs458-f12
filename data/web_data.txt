<TITLE>Frequently Asked Questions for sci.astro [Astronomy]</TITLE>

FAQ for sci.astro 
Frequently Asked Questions in Astronomy
Introduction

sci.astro is a
newsgroup devoted to the discussion of all aspects of astronomy.  As
such its content ranges from the Earth to the farthest reaches of the
Universe.  However, certain questions tend to appear fairly regularly.
This document (the FAQ) attempts to summarize answers to these
questions.



Table of Contents

Introduction to sci.astro


Expanded Table of Contents

The Internet and Other Information SourcesGeneral InformationTime, Calendars, and Terrestrial PhenomenaAstrophysicsSun, Moon, and PlanetsExtraterrestrial LifeStarsGalaxies, Clusters, and QuasarsCosmology (this section of the
       FAQ is derived from Ned Wright's Cosmology
       Tutorial and the associated discussion of the errors
       in alternative cosmologies)

Comments and questions, as well as volunteers to write additional
sections(!), are always welcome.


Mirrors

I maintain a partial list of mirrors,
both ftp and Web ones.  Typical file sizes are

Credit

Much thanks is due Steve Willner who started the entire process of
producing an FAQ for sci.astro.


Thanks to astronomy.net for
hosting the FAQ.


The images at the top of this document show the sky at the extremes of
the electromagnetic spectrum.  On the left is the gamma-ray sky
(< 100 MeV; EGRET); on the right is the radio
(408 MHz; Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg and Parkes).  Almost all of
our information about the Universe comes to us from electromagnetic
radiation with wavelengths between these two extremes.  The images were
obtained from SkyView.

				Finding Lawyers Online: Four Qualities to Look For
		
		April 21, 2012  By Randy Leave a Comment 		
			
Image via Flickr
 
When you need law counsel, the last thing you want to do is scour the yellow pages and start dialing. You might find a reputable attorney this way, but you might not efficiently do so. Finding a lawyer online may seem like a challenge, but not if you know what to look for.
Reputation
You want to find a lawyer with a solid reputation for being honest and fair with clients. Start out by asking friends and family for referrals. If you come up empty-handed, ask colleagues and others in professional or recreational groups you belong to.
After you’ve narrowed down the list, do a quick search online. If an attorney has a proven track record of successful court hearings or otherwise a history of cheating clients, you will find it in the results. Search the Better Business Bureau for any complaints. If there are complaints, see what the resolution was before you judge.
Character
You want a lawyer with the right character that will better serve your needs. If you’re in a nasty divorce, you might want a shark—an equally resolute and persevering advocate—who pursues everything he can for his clients. A fierce lawyer will help you when you’re contesting a divorce or fighting for assets. If your divorce is amicable, you don’t want a shark in the tank at all.
Personality
Working side by side with an attorney during legal proceedings yields some pretty sensitive personal information. You want a lawyer that’s friendly and dependable.
If you’re not comfortable with your lawyer, he cannot serve you properly. It’s difficult to feel comfortable when someone is grouchy and unpleasant.
You want a dependable attorney. There’s nothing more frustrating than unreturned phone calls, unanswered questions, and an elusive lawyer. You want to find someone who keeps the communication channels open and is always ready to hear what you have to say.
Confidence
When you’re in the thick of legal proceedings, the last thing you need is an attorney that’s wordless or rambling. Good lawyers have a way with words and make valid arguments. You’ll be better represented by a confident lawyer capable of making a clear, concise argument on your behalf.
While it’s not the most defining factor in choosing a lawyer, cost cannot be ignored. Choosing a lawyer based on cost isn’t a wise choice. The most expensive lawyer isn’t always the best and vice versa. You’ll also want to stay in a price range that’s affordable for you. You don’t want mountains of debt when your case is over.
Needing legal counsel is rarely a good time in life. Make cases end in your favor by hiring the best attorney you can. Choosing an online lawyer is easier when you know what to look for.

				Keeping Your Teens in the Right Path for Financial Success
		
		March 14, 2012  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			Everyone wants to give their kids the building blocks for success in many areas, such as health, career and financial success. Out of all of these, none is as important as financial success.
Financial success now and in the future can actually affect a young adult’s health and career status. One of the number one stressors in an adult’s life is financial stress, and stress affects health.
Employers are looking at credit scores increasingly as a means to determine employment status. Here are some tips to help keep your teen on the right financial path.
Allowance
It is a good idea to give your teen an opportunity to earn an allowance. This not only helps instill good work values, but financial responsibility as well. It should be decided what exactly the allowance will be and what responsibilities are to be given. Will he be working for his everyday spending?
Credit
Teach teens to use credit responsibly and why their credit rating is important. Young adults are bombarded with credit card offers even while they’re still in high school. Teach them to use credit wisely and responsibly. Explain what should and shouldn’t be financed on credit cards. Educate them about carrying a credit card balance and how to build their credit ratings.
Financing
If your teen has the means to pay a loan, let them finance something small such as a used car so they understand what it’s like to fill out a loan application. Let them see the importance of making payments in a timely manner or see what the consequences are when you finance something and the payments do not get made.
Emergency Situations
Help them know where to seek help in an emergency situation.  Plain Green Loans is providing personal loans to help people out of a tight jam. Advise them of the importance of saving for emergency situations.
Budgeting
Involve teens in the budgeting process for the household. Let them see what every day household expenses may cost, such as electricity, water or groceries. This helps avoid so-called sticker shock when they get out in that real world.
As financial times get tougher and tougher for the average American, it is becoming more and more important to teach good financial strategies at home.  Teach your teens habits that will set them on the right path for financial success in their future.

				Four Ways on How to Secure Affordable Apartments in Sacramento
		
		March 6, 2012  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			Image Courtesy of Flickr
Getting a great apartment is only the first part of your work to become established in a city the size of Sacramento. When you start out, you may not have a lot, but you want to make sure you have a strong base to keep what you do have. Your safety and the security of your possessions are of paramount importance. The following are some ways to keep your person and property safe from harm.
Require Good Locks
When you shop for Sacramento apartments, pay careful attention to how many doors and how many locks keep any passing person from getting to your potential place. No matter how affordable an apartment might be, it’s not worth your time and money if the landlord doesn’t care about security. Don’t be afraid to go elsewhere if the place’s locks and doors aren’t up to snuff.
Be Aware of the Area
As much as your apartment’s locks are important, the neighborhood you live in is even more so. Two different neighborhoods separated by only a few blocks can have massive differences in their crime statistics. Before you even move into an apartment, you have both the right and the responsibility to know what you’re getting yourself into. Some neighborhoods are great, some are good and some might give you pause. Knowing which one you’ll potentially be living in is an important step.
Meet Your Neighbors
Being a friendly and outgoing neighbor is about way more than just borrowing things and having people to hang out with when your friends are busy. A good neighborhood means that every neighbor watches out for each other. While you might be the world champion at karate and have a gun that you’re a crack shot with, those things won’t do your apartment any good if you’re off visiting relatives or you’re at work. Neighbors, on the other hand, can call the police the moment anything suspicious happens.
Be Insured
Do you have a lot of tech toys, nice clothes and other goodies that you’d like to keep? No matter what you do, sometimes theft happens. The easiest way to sidestep this problem is to make sure you have plenty of renter’s insurance. It isn’t expensive, and it can help you regain everything you’d lose if your apartment were ever broken into by some crook. If you have a decent laptop, protecting it alone is worth several years of having renter’s insurance. Plus, how much is a little peace of mind worth to you?
Your apartment is your base. You need your base to be a safe, secure place for yourself and your things. Every avenue you can take toward making it safer and more secure is worth trying. Go ahead and try all the good suggestions above.

				How Can Asian American Teens Adjust to Different Environments?
		
		February 13, 2012  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			Image via Wikipedia
Growing up in two different environments may be difficult for an Asian American teenager. The home environment and the school environment have various social and cultural demands; although some may overlap, the majority will be a stark contrast to one another.
Growing up in an Asian American household means adopting specific social etiquettes that may be acceptable or preferred in the home, but will appear strange in a different environment, in a way that makes them feel comfortable in both environments. For example, Asian Americans often take their shoes off at the entrance of their homes and do not wear shoes around the house. While this small custom is hardly noticeable for Asian Americans, it becomes very apparent if he or she visits the home of a non-Asian American whose family does wear shoes around the house. Other customs, such as eating rice and using chopsticks, are even more noticeable if time is spent at school or at a non-Asian American’s home.
How does one adjust to these different environments? Asian Americans learn to adapt to different environments simply by imitating their peers. What may seem strange at first becomes normal after continuous repetition. Never used a fork before? Practice every day and you’ll get the hang of it. One simply needs to put effort in understanding and realizing the changes, and in no time, Asian Americans will be able to adjust to the different environments. Famous Asian Americans have constantly had to adjust to their environment and learn society’s way of doing things, whether they are in business, media, fashion, sports, or law. For example, fashion designers such as Alexander Wang have adapted an American and European style to cater to his audience’s preferences.
It is one thing to adjust to an environment, but a totally different thing to feel comfortable in both. The most important part of adjusting and adapting to different environments is the continued education, growth, and acceptance. Do not reject one environment in favor of another. Instead, embrace both environments and cultures. Asian Americans are both Asian and American, so it is natural to feel a tie to both cultures. Similarly, because they are both Asian and American, they should also be able to accept both dimensions of their characters. Being open to different possibilities gives individuals a greater understanding of the people around them. Empathy, sympathy, and connection stem from understanding other people and their predicaments. Asian Americans are special because they have the best of two worlds, something not all Americans may have access to.

				Most Affordable Air Travel for Teens
		
		January 23, 2012  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			There are many ways to travel; traveling for business, flying from one destination to another to conduct business with partners or investors. There is travel for fun, vacations, visits with family or friends you have not seen in a long time. Even young people travel a lot, whether it’s for school or for leisure. Air travel is a convenient mode of transportation when they go on academic trips or school breaks, whether it’s local or abroad. It is easy for their parents to make the arrangements for them or for the whole family. This is why the traveling teen is a growing trend in recent years.
 
Image via Wikipedia

Today’s teens have such a sense of independence. They no longer want to visit their relatives with mom and dad during their down time. They want to go with their friends, who have found some desirable teen destination where their peers are vacationing. Wanting to be with friends and not family is not really surprising; it has just been made more obvious because of all the technology available today. What will never change is that it is up to mom and dad to figure out how to send their teens on their vacation even when they’re not around.
 
Image via Wikipedia

The worries begin to bundle. Where are they going? Who are they going with? How long will they be there? How do we pay for this? If flying, where can we find cheap airline tickets?
The teens themselves have done their research. They know where they are going, having been on the Internet and talked with their friends about the hot vacation spots for teens. It is now time for mom and dad to come up with the travel arrangements. A bit of searching and homework is involved, but this is to find the best deals for the air travel. The airlines are looking for your business. In this economy, the deals are in your favor. Many airlines are now catering to groups of teenagers, a fast growing group of travelers.
Saved frequent flyer miles can certainly help. If an immediate family member is a seasoned traveler, their frequent flyer miles can be used by anyone in the family, making the trip for the teen easier on the wallet for mom and dad. Search the web, one of the best places airlines or travel sites list the deals they offer. With the help of search engines, you can conveniently list and compare prices to get the best deal possible.

				Resolving Your Teen’s Money Problems
		
		January 6, 2012  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			Image by Tangolarina via flickr
Nowadays, teenagers have expensive taste with regards to the newest clothing, music, technology, food and entertainment, making them the perfect target for market. Adding to that, teens today have this pay-later attitude. Some of them are fostered to become financially responsible, but that’s only possible if they got proper nurturing in terms of financial management.
Teaching your teen to manage money may seem like a daunting task, but an informed approach to money management can help you and your teen cross this crucial hurdle towards a life of financial success and stability without the tears.
Encourage your Teen’s on Part-Time Work
Understanding the value of money is the foundation of sensible spending and saving. Helping your teen find a part-time job at a local store or restaurant will empower him or her to make special purchases for themselves, encouraging independence, self-reliance and confidence.  This will also teach them the how to manage time by balancing school and work, discipline on time and the trouble with taxes.
Earning their own income, teens will learn relate the money in the bank to their hard worked hours, encouraging more practical and informed decisions about leasing that brand new gadget or picking up that much-coveted designer hand bag.
Talk It Out: Financial Transparency
Be honest with your teens about what your family can afford.  Planning ahead is the best way to accommodate extra expense and little luxuries. At the beginning of the school year, sit down with your child and discuss the added incidentals that can be predicted for the year to come from formal gowns to movie tickets or new sport equipment.  Then discuss options for added income or ways to save within the existing budget from cutting out those $4 lattes on the way to school or applying for scholarships to balance out the cost of college applications and standardized tests.
Teach your Teen’s on how to Manage their Spending
Teenagers tend to be more knowledgeable about the use of money when they are thought on how to save and spend. If you are successful in helping your teen understand the difference between wants and needs, they can easily grasp the value of saving and planning for the future.
Teens should also be encouraged to compare alternatives, make decisions and take responsibility when it comes to dealing with debts. You never know when your kids will be put in emergency financial situations, so it’s best to introduce them on alternatives like payday advance online. Unexpected financial emergencies could eat away their budget no matter how careful they are, so it’s vital to give them a good option for support. Teach them on when and where to maximize those short-term loans and not just to squander it for personal luxuries.

				Enjoy More What You Already Enjoy Doing
		
		January 5, 2012  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			Loans are often a lifesaver for people who want to continue enjoying what they’re already doing. Often, sudden and unexpected events arise when you least expect it. Engine problems while on a road trip, motor problems while on a fishing expedition or weather delays at the airport that cost time and money for extra meals and a hotel room. These kinks in your plans don’t have to put an end to your finances.
Many companies offer an online application process for emergency situations. Once you’ve been approved for a loan, the money usually shows up in your bank account the same or the next day. The only caveat, especially for payday loans, is that the money should be paid back by the next paycheck in order to avoid late fees and other penalties.
The following are some tips on how to get personal installment loans for your benefit:
Image from Flickr
Online Approval Makes it Easy

No matter where you are, the Internet has made applying for personal installment loans simple. Just find the website of the company where you wish to apply for a loan, and then fill in the loan application process. If you’re approved, you should receive the emergency money within a short period of time.
Be Aware of Application Fees
Online lenders should be competing for your business. Therefore, if you find a site that charges an up-front fee, you should be wary and look elsewhere. You’ll find plenty of companies that are willing to loan you the money for emergency situations without charging you with any up-front fee.
Read the Fine Print
Before you agree to the loan transaction to pay for your urgent needs, read the fine print. Be aware of any late fees, penalties and the company’s right to adjust the interest fee on negligent payments. Always be aware of your rights and those of the loan company before agreeing to the loan terms.
No Credit Check
There are loan companies that will offer to bypass the credit check process in order for you to qualify for an emergency loan. You may choose this option if you’ve previously declared bankruptcy or if you have bad credit.
Be advised, however, that no credit check loans often come with higher interest rates and steeper penalties. If you really need the money for an emergency financial need, just be sure you can pay it back within the parameters of the loan agreement.
Securing personal installment loans can be a great way to overcome emergency situations like the medical bills for a sudden trip to the hospital after an accident. Just make sure that you don’t borrow more than you can pay back, and realize that if you do default on the loan, you can seriously jeopardize your credit rating.

				Keeping Kids Entertained on Airplanes
		
		November 27, 2011  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			Do you have a toddler, young child or even a teen who will be flying with you on your next trip? Keeping little ones entertained at home is hard enough; how will you manage occupying their attention in a cramped airplane seat for hours at a time? Here are a few tips and tricks for helping kids handle the plane ride well.
Watch Movies and TV Shows
Kids usually have favorite movies or TV shows that keep them entertained for hours. Bring a portable DVD player or other a tablet PC loaded with your child’s favorite shows.
 
Image via Wikipedia
Have Snacks on Hand
Few things break up large chunks of time better than snack time. Bring a few different snacks that your child prefers. You can extend snack time by playing games with the food, such as counting cereal pieces or sorting candies by color. If you pack your snacks in sealable containers or paper bags, these can be used as toys later in the flight!
Play Self-Contained Games
Many traditional toys aren’t well suited to airplane rides. Avoid any toys with small parts that can roll under seats. Self-contained toys and games are your best bet. You can make a book out of old clothes that lets your child practice using buckles, zippers and buttons. If you don’t fancy making such a book yourself, there are many styles available for purchase.
Magazines can be another source of fun for kids. Create a scavenger hunt with the magazines or other printed materials the airline offers. Name something you see on the page, and have your child find it.
Create a few discovery bottles before you go. Fill an empty bottle with small toys and shreds of paper; the child will have to move the container around to uncover the toy. Alternatively, they may have to grab a magnet and use it to move cut-up parts of pipe cleaners around a plastic bottle. These discovery bottles are inexpensive to make yourself and can easily be packed in a carry-on bag.
Tell Stories
Tell your child stories about where you are going and who you are visiting. If you’re on your way to see grandpa and grandma, share memories about what you did the last time you visited them. You can also make up fanciful stories about what you will do on this trip.
As you’re preparing for your next vacation, remember that a successful flight with your child needs more preparation than simply searching for cheap flights. Make the flight an enjoyable experience for your child and less stressful for you, by following these simple tips.

				Does Anyone Go to the Movies Anymore?
		
		July 22, 2011  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			If you look at the numbers, movies are still big. Open weekends are breaking records and every movie is a blockbuster. But are people going to movies to see the movie or because they are afraid not to?
In the world of teens, movies and television dominate pop culture. And with all the cross marketing, movies become video games, breed hit songs, are the latest apps, and transform fashion trends. The movie itself almost becomes secondary to the process.
When the latest hit movie is decided upon, usually months before it opens, the studio machine starts to find every vein to tap into to make it more than just a movie. It’s an event.
The lifestyle of the teen is based mainly upon peer groups and relationships. With all the uncertainty that comes with that age, one of the clearest ways of defining oneself at that age is by pop culture trend. It becomes black and white: either you are part of the trend or you’re not. The quickest way to be part of a group becomes to become part of the event. If you miss the movie, don’t wear the clothes, don’t know the song, you become one of them instead of one of us.
Again, the questions, does anyone go to the movies anymore or are people just afraid of being defined as the one who doesn’t go?

				Mobile Devices – Not Just Phone Anymore
		
		July 20, 2011  By admin Leave a Comment 		
			
Image via Wikipedia

It wasn’t too long ago that an iPod and cell phone were considered the peak of status. They were expensive and not everyone could have them. Nowadays, the electronics world had again pushed us forward to the point where MP3 players and phones are considered just the beginning of the mobile arsenal.
Teens want the latest technology. Whether it’s a video game, the latest laptop or a cutting-edge phone, the best toys are the newest toys. Electronics makers are aware of the consumer want and are well equipped to feed the beast. The latest gadgets are designed to promote education and learning but often fall into the trap of jumping on a pop culture trend instead of innovating.
Devices like tablet PCs and smart phones which are still feats of technological genius are now nothing but places to show off the latest fashion trends and pop culture icons. But tides are turning and the fickle nature of tweens and teens turn trends into personal development. Financial considerations move teens out the instant gratification mode and into a consumer experts looking for the best deals.
Mobile devices continue to grow and the desire for new ones shows no signs of slowing.

The sci.astro FAQ

Introduction


sci.astro is a newsgroup devoted to the
discussion of the science of astronomy.  As such its content ranges
from the Earth to the farthest reaches of the Universe.



However, certain questions tend to appear fairly regularly.  This
document attempts to summarize answers to these questions.



This document is posted on the first and third Wednesdays of each
month to the newsgroup sci.astro.  It is
available via anonymous
ftp, and it is on the World Wide Web at the sci.astro FAQ
site and Internet FAQ 
Archives.  A partial list of worldwide mirrors (both
ftp and Web) is also available.  (As a general note, many other FAQs
are also available from rtfm.mit.edu.)


Questions/comments/flames should be directed to the FAQ maintainer,
Joseph Lazio <jlazio@patriot.net>.

          Welcome to the Wharton Financial Institutions Center, an independently managed site at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The Center sponsors and directs primary research on financial institutions and their interface with financial markets. The Center was established in 1992 with funds provided by the Sloan Foundation and was designated as the Sloan Industry Center for Financial Institutions, the first such center designated for a service-sector industry. It is now supported by private research partners, corporate sponsors, and various foundations and non-profit organizations. The Center has hundreds of affiliated scholars at leading institutions world-wide, and it continues to define the research frontier, hosting an influential working paper series and a variety of conferences (academic, industry, and crossover).

            - LPFM vs. Translators: A "Resolution" [link
      to this story]
      Last week,
          the FCC approved        significant rule changes to the low-power FM radio
        service; this week the agency formally released        the text of those changes. 
      There's a
          lot of good things in the latest Report
          and Order. LPFM stations have
          finally achieved something close
          to technical and legal
          parity with FM translator stations. LPFM rules have been refined to
        provide a substantive preference for those who actually plan to
        focus
          on live and local programming. And the next filing window for new LPFM
        stations will open in the fall of next year. 
      The more
          truly community radio stations there are, the better our
          media
          environment
          becomes. But it's a bittersweet accomplishment in the face of the
          massive grab for FM spectrum that took place between 1997 - the year
          the first LPFM Petitions for Rulemaking were filed by the public -
          and today.      
      The short
          backstory: when the FCC opened
          its first LPFM filing window more than 10 years ago, it froze applications
          for new FM
        translator stations until 2003. That year, nearly 14,000 translator applications
        were filed - many were openly speculative, tendered by groups who
          planned to flip these stations to willing buyers for thousands of
          dollars apiece (if
        not more). 
      Belatedly
            recognizing that there were shenanigans afoot, in 2005 the agency
              froze the processing of further translator applications from that
            filing window until it had resolved the future buildout of LPFM.      The new Report
          and Order thus not only sets the parameters for the LPFM service's
          expansion, but
          also resolves
        the translator mess. The latter matter I find the most interesting.
      The
          FCC has previously been reluctant to openly admit that the flood of
          FM translator applications were
          fishy, but in the latest
        ruling
        it minces no words. Most of the applications filed in 2003
          were "for speculative purposes (either for potential sale or to
          game the auction system) rather than a good-faith intent to construct
          and
          operate
          the proposed stations." The translator-grab delayed "the
          processing of bona fide applications, thereby impeding efforts to bring
          new service to the public" and "also delayed the introduction
        of new LPFM service."
      3,476 new
          FM translator construction permits have been granted from the 2003
          application-flood. Had they all been built, it would've doubled the
          number of translator stations
          in
          the
          United
          States. Of those
            grants, "926 (more than 25 percent)
          were never constructed and 1,358 (almost 40 percent)
      were assigned to a party other than the applicant" (i.e., sold).
      The evidence
          of speculation is clear and rampant."[O]ne applicant holds 24
          of the 24 translator applications proposing operation
          within
          20
          kilometers
          of Houston’s reference
        coordinates and 73 applications in Texas. Two applicants hold 66 of the
        74 applications proposing service to the New York City radio market."
      Of the those
          who participated in the translator-grab, two organizations stand above
          the rest: Radio Assist Ministry/Edgewater
          Broadcasting and the Educational
          Media
          Foundation,
        both of which are
        religious entities.
        RAM/EB filed 4,219 applications in 2003 and received 1,046 construction
          permits before the freeze. RAM/EB has since tried to sell half of these,
          closing
        deals
        on "more
        than 400" and netting millions of dollars in the process.
      EMF received 259 translator construction permits since
        2003, of
        which nearly 30% have been sold, cancelled, or "otherwise terminated."
      It still has 292 outstanding applications.
      Yet the agency's
          latest ruling does nothing to rectify this assault on the public airwaves.
          Instead, the FCC has instituted
        a cap on pending translator applications - each speculator will only be
        allowed another 70 applications to be processed, but they will
        only be granted if they don't preclude the placement of LPFM stations. 
      This cap,
          says the agency, is necessary "to preserve the integrity of our
          licensing process" - integrity that was decimated by the activity
          that's taken place between 2003 and today. The
          FCC says this course of action is the most administratively expedient
          way of clearing the application backlog and expediting the expansion
          of
          LPFM.
        It also claims any anti-trafficking rules regarding translators "would
        be highly subject to circumvention" and
        the process of monitoring for and enforcing such regulations "would
        unduly burden administrative resources and could delay processing" of
        other broadcast license applications. 
      This is policy-speak
          for closing the barn door after the horses have fled.      
      Ultimately,
          comparative numbers
          tell the tale. During the introductory round of LPFM licensing,
          more than 3,000 applications
        were
        filed,
        from
        which 1,327 construction permits were granted. Of those, 791
        LPFM stations remain on the air today. About half of those are religious
        stations.
      Meanwhile,
          more than 6,000 FM translators are already on the air - nearly half
          of which got there by anti-democratic means while the
          struggle
          for LPFM untangled itself. Although
          several thousand LPFM applications are expected during
          next year's filing window, the number of actual stations that will
        make it on the air will be far fewer, doubling (or perhaps tripling)
        the number of LPFM stations nationwide. 
      Translators
          currently outnumber LPFM stations by a factor of 7-to-1. Following
            the resolution of the next LPFM filing window, this disparity may
          be reduced to something like 3-to-1.       But if the
          stable of prospective LPFM applicants breaks down the way they did
          the first time around, churches
            and other religious groups are likely to be the biggest winners.
          Considering that many of them run LPFM stations like translators (not
          really live,
          not really local), what does that portend for the real-world impact
      of the service?
      Incidentally,
            the latest Report
          and Order allows LPFM stations to own and operate up to two of their own FM
          translator stations. Instead of actually promulgating policies
          that curb the creative reliance on translators by broadcasters (often
          for purposes for which the service was never intended), the FCC seems
          to encourage it.      
      The saga
          of LPFM's development and the translator invasion are intimately linked.
          In terms of access to public spectrum, the struggle to bring meaningful
          diversity and
          public access to the airwaves has been eclipsed by the explosive growth
          of low-power repeater-stations. 
      This is likely
          to be the last significant opportunity for the expansion of the LPFM
          service - the hard work now
            begins to make
            the most of it.

                - Beware Broacasters' Post-Sandy Opportunism [link
          to this story]
      One month
          ago today, those of us in NYC and the surrounding area were hunkering
          down and riding out a storm named Sandy.
          As conditions worsened and disruptions in communications technologies multiplied,
        people did something they don't often do en masse anymore: they turned
          to radio to find out what was going on. 
      A
            few radio stations did
          provide an informational
          and emotional lifeline, demonstrating
          that the medium still has an important role to play in our modern
          media
          environment.
        The ubiquity of broadcasting, coupled with the ease of access to it (no
        device necessary save for a cheap receiver, no contracts, no terms of
        service) made radio the go-to medium after almost everything else stopped
        working.
      Broadcasters
          are trumpeting this in the context of a policy initiative
        they'd desperately like to see: a government mandate for
        radio reception in mobile
          phones. With the
          benefit of storm experience, I can better understand the rationale
          behind this notion. But still can't bring myself to
        support the idea, for two primary reasons.
      The first
          involves the lionization of smartphones. Yes, they can do many different
          things, and that is pretty neat. But the navigation
        of life does not occur through a single piece
        of technology. Smartphones are complicated devices, with many potential
          points of failure. A standard AM/FM radio receiver, on the other hand,
          is not. You can't find cheap, disposable batteries sold in bulk for
        a smartphone.
      While it
            is true that many people don't buy radios anymore - they buy devices
            that happen to have radios in them - it doesn't
            obviate the need or desire for a stand-alone receiver. Also note
          that any receiver
            mandate
          for smartphones only covers FM: the electrically-noisy environment
          inside such devices makes AM reception questionable at best.       
      While many
          smartphones already have the chipset in them for FM reception, it's
          a bit more
        complicated than installing
        an app to access this functionality. The
        chip must be
          wired to the "antenna" (i.e., the connection for your headphones
          or earbuds, without which a radio app won't work) and the phone's firmware
          must
          be programmed/updated to utilize the functionality. It's this "hidden
        cost" which is at the center of the consumer electronics industry's
        opposition to a radio reception mandate. 
      But my second
          concern is the larger one: a Sandy-hyped mandate for FM compatibility
          might be used as a stalking horse to impose
          HD Radio reception technology
          in phones. Heaven knows the technology could use the boost: iBiquity
          Digital
        Corporation recently
        announced that the number of HD
        Radios sold in the
        United States finally cracked the 10 million mark - reaching a 1% penetration
        rate a full 10 years after the technology was first introduced. The increase
        is wholly
        due
        to
          the 
          automotive
          market, where some manufacturers have added HD functionality
        to their in-dash entertainment systems.
      The rub is
            that while more people may now have access to HD programming, a significant
            segment of them didn't actively
            seek it out - it came
          with the car,
          in which they might not even really use the radio much to begin with.
          The same situation would exist with smartphones: the installed receiver
          base might
          skyrocket, but that's no guarantee that listenership would. (No
          HD signal in and of itself has made a blip in the Arbitron ratings
            yet.)      
      Considering
          the general ignorance of policymakers (especially Congress) regarding
          how communications technologies actually work,
        it's an expensive and convoluted (but crafty way) of using "market
        incentives"
        to get broadcasters to adopt HD. The FCC made its deployment optional
        precisely because the technology is proprietary.
      Whereas adding
          analog FM reception functionality to a smartphone represents a pennies-per-unit
        cost, the chipset and software necessary for
        HD reception resultingly costs much more. 
      In this instance,
              a mandate effectively represents
              a tax that enriches a proprietary business model. Imagine the outcry
          if the government mandated the use of Windows over
          Apple (or vice versa) in an everyday device.
      Once
                a mandate for analog FM is established, the political hurdle
          for an
            HD
            mandate
            is much lower, because ignorant policymakers don't understand the
          difference between analog and digital radio and subscribe to the popular
          fallacy
            that digital always equals "better."
      It's still
          quite likely that the political
          and economic
          recalcitrance of
          the consumer electronics industry will carry the day,
        aided by modern America's inability to remember much of anything outside
        of the recent past. The sad thing is, such disaster opportunism is likely
        to become more frequent as climate change becomes more severe.

              - Larry Bloch: 1953-2012 [link
        to this story]
      Larry
            Bloch, a founding member of radio
            free brattleboro,
        died last month of pancreatic cancer. He was 59.
      Bloch was
          one of those rare and lucky folks for whom activism was a full-time
          vocation. After working with Greenpeace throughout the 1980s,
        he created  the Wetlands
        Preserve in New York City in 1989.
        The nightclub became a magnet for many bands that rose to fame out of
        the "alternative" music
        soup of the 1990s. 
      The Wetlands
          also served as an activist hub and quasi-infoshop, with meeting space
          in the basement that incubated many ideas and causes.       
      Bloch sold
          the Wetlands in 1996 (the club would close in 2001, a victim of gentrification
          in lower Manhattan) and moved
        to Brattleboro, Vermont. There he founded Save
        the Corporations From Themselves, a retail
        outlet devoted to environmentally-friendly clothing and other goods.
        
      The store
          also featured the Activist Attic, a convergence space much like what
          the basement of the Wetlands used to be.      
      It was through
          gatherings at the Attic where radio free brattleboro, an unlicensed
          10-watt micropower FM station, was born in 1998. rfb
          had a long and storied run in Brattleboro and enjoyed a massive amount
        of support from the town. FCC field agents found hostile reception there
          on several fronts. 
      After the
          station was raided in June of 2003,
          it promptly returned to the air and
          launched an unprecedented campaign to
          document its community support.
          This resulted in the passage
          of a referendum by which the citizens
          of the town granted their own authorization
          for rfb's continued existence until such time as the FCC would give
          the community an LPFM license. 
      The FCC countered
          with a request for a court injunction to bar radio free brattleboro
          from broadcasting. This request was initially
          denied by a
          federal District Court judge, who was swayed enough by the station's
          demonstrable support to press the
          FCC for a more detailed justification
          to silence them. 
      Bloch was
          instrumental in organizing the station's defense. This deferral        allowed
          radio free brattleboro to continue operating until June of 2005, when
          the station was raided again by
          the FCC. Ironically, just three months before this raid, a group
          called Vermont Earth Works was awarded
          an LPFM construction permit and the
          process began to build out
          the "legitimate" station. Mission accomplished. 
      As the direct
          descendant of radio free brattleboro, WVEW-LP features
          the sort of diversity to
          which all LPFM stations should aspire. Bloch held down a Tuesday evening
          slot, during which he would often play tapes from shows at the Wetlands,
          maxing out WVEW's online stream capacity in the process. Between rfb
          and WVEW, Bloch spent some 14 years on Brattleboro's airwaves, and
          his
          work in
          this
          particular arena stands to be his longest-lasting legacy.      
      WVEW is planning a tribute broadcast to air in Bloch's
        old time-slot, the date still to be determined.

  of siting pirate scanner on a network somewhere,
  then you may aswell use it for other things.
  You will need isa slot for cadet radio card.
  
  Operating system
  Use your favourite distribtion of linux.
  I am using Redhat 9.0 for this project.
  Install redhat as a server
  Make 'scanner' user and password.
  Start sshd & httpd services.
  Close unecessary service such as 'sendmail' and 'cups'.
  Set hostname.
