				textbook:

				Introduction to Information Retrieval (2008) [Available online]. Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich Schutze.
				summary:
				In this course we will explore how search engines work and will cover: basic text processing, index construction, text similarity, evaluation, and searching of other types of media. In addition, we will examine related application areas including language modeling, clustering, classification and e-commerce.

																		My main research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning. My current research has been focusing on text simplification, though I've also been interested in computer science educational research as well as applications in social networking and e-commerce.


																		Resources for the paper "A Course-long Information Retrieval Project"

																		We built a search engine called "Bursti" in Fall 09 in the information retrieval course (cs160). Check it out. To find out more about how it works see the white papers.

																		Some fun in the Fall09 intro course studying strings. Less enthused 10 min. later :)
